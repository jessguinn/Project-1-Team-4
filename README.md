Brief Introduction

Our main research topic is on the analysis of rising cases of diabetes in the United States. We collected data from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention. By utilizing excel, python, and jupyter notebook we combined and cleansed our datasets and compiled a dataframe with the majority of our data combined. We created multiple visuals to show trends, populations, rates, and interesting information related to our project.

Conclusion

We identified our limitations and lessons learned from our colaborative project, and enjoyed the experience to work as a team to meet our overall goal. We hope to continue and grow and develop our skills for our data science ventures.

We hope you enjoyed our presentation and look forward to more challeges!
